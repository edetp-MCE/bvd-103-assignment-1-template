# Project Name: 
    McMasterful Books

# Project Description:
    You will set up a back-end API for “McMasterful Books” that allows their website to
    list the books they have in stock. You will start by setting up a repository and opening it within a Dev
    Container, get a TypeScript & Koa based server running on Node, and then create the API endpoint
    for listing and filtering the books.
